# DroppinData

Code is live at https://www.droppindata.com

DroppinData is a companion app to the video game Fortnite. This application can be used to track game data, reveal trends in how you perform at different locations, and select a location for you to drop to based on your data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. **Database configuration for live deployment is not available on github. In order to work on codebase set up and run your own mongoDB**

### Prerequisites

All dependencies are listed in the package.json

### Installing

Clone the repo to your local machine. Navigate to the directory and install dependencies with npm or with yarn:
`npm install || yarn install`

To run locally:
